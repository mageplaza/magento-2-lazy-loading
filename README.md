## 4. Highlight Features
 

### Load images by demand

#### Hold up loading out-of-view images 

This feature makes the images loaded only in the parts which users are viewing in the entire page. Other images will not load until the users scroll to the next part of the page. Similarly, images will load as users are viewing. 

#### Optimize page loading 

Lazy Loading significantly speeds up the page loading, especially for long websites. You no longer have to wait for a long time to open a page as all images of the page will not load at the same time. This function makes it easier for visitors to view your page. Therefore, it reduces the bounce rate and increases conversions.

#### Placeholders
- Transparent: the most effective one to enhance Lighthouse results. 
- Blur: this effect makes the transaction load smoothly.

### Adjust loading point time

In the Magento Default, once the user opens a page, images of the page will load immediately. With Lazy Loading, you can make specific images to load earlier by using the threshold parameter. 

For instance, if you set the threshold value is 200px, then the image load that appears within 200px will be far from the user’s visible area. 

This feature keeps the constancy of the image appearance as well as saves the bandwidth.
